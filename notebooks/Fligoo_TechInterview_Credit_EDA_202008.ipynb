    "## Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you have to load all the libraries you need to explore and process the given dataset, and then perform the analysis to extract meaningful facts in order to understand the information involved. You are free to make any kind of analytic you want, but at the end it is expected to have done the \"mandatory\" tasks on this work. In addition, there are some \"desirable\" aspects that would enrich the work done, and some \"bonus\" tasks as well to obtain an oustanding valoration in this interview.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: provide reports in English.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mandatory\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stack of technologies:** The analysis on this notebook should be done by using at least the following stack:   \n",
    "    - Python 3.x (not 2.x)\n",
    "    - Pandas 1.0.x\n",
    "    - Numpy 1.18.x\n",
    "- **Data QA:** You must check the quality of the given dataset to make an assessment of how appropriate it is for later Data Science tasks. Propose a set of corrective actions over the data.     \n",
    "- **Report insights and conclusions:** Describe the results obtained during the exploratory analysis and provide conclusions from a business perspective, supported by charts / tables / metrics.    \n",
    "- **Feature extraction:** Indicate some possible candidates of features that could properly describe the borrowers, either from the given columns or from their transformations.\n",
    "- **Machine Learning approaches:** Describe the possible Machine Learning tasks that could be performed from the given data, which may be valuable in the context of the finance domain (just explain with words, don't fit a model).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Desirable aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code versioning with Git** (you are free to publish it on your own Github/Bitbucket account!).\n",
    "- **Show proficiency in Python:** By showing good practices in the structure and documentation, usage of several programming paradigms (e.g. imperative, OOP, functional), etc.\n",
    "- **Machine Learning approaches:** at least one fitted model with the given data.\n",
    "- **Use cases:** Describe possible use cases for this dataset that could add value to the given business, indicating methods / techniques and algorithms for each of them and justifying the choice made.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dockerfile to setup environment.\n",
    "- Identify features and new attributes / tables that could be relevant or needed for better analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you complete the assessment, please send a ZIP file of the folder with all the resources used in this work (e.g. Jupyter notebook, Python scripts, text files, images, etc) to esteban.delboca@fligoo.com. Then you are going to have a final meeting with the team to discuss the work done in this notebook and answer the questions that could arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Have fun!**\n",
